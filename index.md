# How-to Use the Unity Input System Package

## The True Quick Start Guide

The Input System package from Unity is excellent but the documentation they wrote for it, is not and makes the package almost unusable.
This project hopes to make up for this by giving an overview of how to get started and some of the traps and techniques that
will help you succeed.

See the [Project on GitHub](https://github.com/WazzaMo/howto-unity-input-system/) for the code, in the /src directory.

## OK, I'm Ready Now What?

These links to the documentation will get you going. Each page has a NEXT link at the bottom.
Feel free to follow at your own pace.

[Start with installing the package](./documentation/01-installation.md)

Good luck!!
