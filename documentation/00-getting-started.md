# Getting Started

You might be here because you have a scene and character, and
you want to use the Input System package and find the Unity
documentation unhelpful. I feel your pain - been there.

You might, instead, be newer to Unity and want to try creating
a scene and basic character and try the new Input System.
That's a little different but I have you covered, too.

## Where to Start?

You will need to install the Input System package, if not already done,
have a character to control and then create an Input Action asset
to link input devices (say keyboard) to events and define the type
of control (button, vector2 etc)...

### Install Input System

First things first, make sure the Input System package is installed
(if not already). See [01-installation.md](./installation.md) for
an overview and link to Unity's installation guide - 
that guide is OK.

Then choose one of the two starting points below.

### Making a basic Character

There are assets on the AssetStore for characters you could control.
Let's assume for the moment you want to make something rough and learn a bit
about setting up a scene in the process - that's what this is about.
Follow the instructions in [02-make-scene-and-character.md](./02-make-scene-and-character.md)
for detailed instructions on how to create a basic scene and
character. It's not pretty but it's enough to start with.

### Configuring Input Actions and debugging them

You have a scene, now you need controller components and an Input Action asset that works with it.
Go to the long instructions at [03-create-a-character-motioninput-component.md](./03-create-a-character-motioninput-component.md) to get the step-by-step
Quick Start for a new asset and code to debug this asset. We will build on this.
