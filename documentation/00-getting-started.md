# Getting Started

You might be here because you have a scene and character, and
you want to use the Input System package and find the Unity
documentation unhelpful. I feel your pain - been there.

You might, instead, be newer to Unity and want to try creating
a scene and basic character and try the new Input System.
That's a little different but I have you covered, too.

## Where to Start?

First things first, make sure the Input System package is installed
(if not already). See [01-installation.md](./installation.md) for
an overview and link to Unity's installation guide - 
that guide is OK.

Then choose one of the two starting points below.

### If new to Unity

Follow the instructions in [02-make-scene-and-character.md](./02-make-scene-and-character.md)
for detailed instructions on how to create a basic scene and
character. It's not pretty but it's enough to start with.

### If You Have a Scene

You have a scene, now you need a controller and an input mapping
 asset that works with it.
