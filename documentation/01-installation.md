# Installation

Actually, this is where the Unity documentation is OK.

1. Use the package manager and install the package
2. Make sure the package manager is using the Unity Package Repository so you can find uninstalled Unity packages.
3. A dialog appears asking you to enable the new Input System - click "yes" and let it restart the editor

The details of this are well described in the Unity Input System manual (the best bit of the manual so far).

See [Unity Documentation - Input System Package - Installation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/manual/index.html)
