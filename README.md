# Howto Unity Input System

## Why?

The new Input System package is quite good and creates a very
useful abstraction for handling input and devices that provide
input signals. It should be available to all and it deserves
to be used but it is too hard to use due to bad documentation.

The problem is that as of December 2021, the documentation for
the Input System package is very poor and confusing. It is almost
impossible to follow the quickstart and arrive at a working
solution.
